# ðŸ“š MacNotes 
MacNotes is a course-based note-sharing platform built for McMaster students. It was created to make it easier for students to share and access helpful notes across all programs and courses.

This project is still in progress and weâ€™ve hosted a basic prototype to showcase the core functionality. The design isnâ€™t final yet, but it gives a good idea of what weâ€™ve been working on recently.
